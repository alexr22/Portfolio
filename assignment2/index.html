        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img src="assets/images/ProfilePicture.png" class="img-responsive" alt="A picture of Alex Reinking">
        <p>I am 23 years old and have lived in Austin my entire life.  I went to Austin High School and then studied Petroleum Engineering at the University of Texas.  After graduating in August, 2015, I worked on an oil rig for six months, which was quite the experience.  I hope to go back to the oil and gas industry after I complete the UT Coding Boot Camp.  It would be cool to take what I learn from this course and apply it to that industry.  I am currently working for Reed Insurance Agency and taking classes at night and on the weekends. 
        </p>
        <p>I grew up as the youngest of four children, with two older brothers and an oldest sister.  We loved sports and competing throughout our childhood.  My family is rapidly growing as I have a niece and three nephews.  When I am not working or coding, I enjoy hanging out with friends and family, whether it be playing sports, playing video games, going out to eat, or just hanging out.
